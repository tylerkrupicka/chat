A simple tutorial for building a chat application using `Flask`. The tutorial is set up for [Repl It](https://repl.it), but should work locally as well!

[Read the documentation to get started.](https://tylerkrupicka.com/chat/)

## Skill Level

This tutorial is aimed at Python beginners, who are building their first website. There is some JavaScript code, but all of it is provided and explained so it isn't a barrier. You don't need to know Flask, or web development, to complete the tutorial!

## Using for a Class

If you are using this as part of a class, you may need to edit the documentation to adjust the difficulty. At the end of the tutorial there are some ideas for enhancements, with the goal being students could pick features that interest them and implement them.

## Making Changes

If you see any issues, you can navigate to the appropriate file and hit `edit` in GitHub. From there you should be able to open a pull request to suggest changes.
